### d. Memberships & Fees

**Purchases, taxes, and fees.** You are responsible for paying any amounts due, including any applicable taxes, when you make purchases on LearnGrove.

By placing an order, you represent and warrant that the billing information you’ve provided is accurate. As set forth in section five below, for states with applicable marketplace collection laws, and for certain other states in which Datagrove has received permission (including by having entered into a collection agreement), Datagrove will calculate, collect, and remit applicable sales tax. Where sales tax applies to your order, the amount of tax due will be estimated at checkout and may differ from the final sales tax amount that will be charged when your order is processed.

## 2. LearnGrove Community

### a. Community Guidelines

As a User of our Services, you are required to follow our [Community Guidelines](https://support.learngrove.co/frequently-asked/community-guidelines/) which are incorporated as part of these Terms. We may modify or add to these rules at our discretion. If you violate any of these rules, we may take action against your Account, such as removing Content you’ve posted, removing Resources from your Account, suspending or terminating your Account, removing Resources from your Buyer, issuing a refund to your Buyer(s), or any additional action that we deem necessary.

### b. Comments, Ratings & Reviews

You may have the option to provide a review of a Resource you’ve purchased (including free resources) or Event you attended by providing a rating and a comment (“Feedback”). Any Feedback you choose to leave should reflect your honest experience using the Resource for its intended purpose and must comply with our Comments and Ratings Guidelines. We may, at any time, set additional requirements or limitations for leaving Feedback. Sellers may not leave Feedback on their own Resources or otherwise attempt to undermine the integrity of our Feedback system. We may remove Feedback for any reason, at any time, without notice and we may ban a Member from leaving future Feedback.

### c. Monitoring Content

We may investigate any complaints or reported violations of our policies and take any action that we deem appropriate. Such action may include, but is not limited to, issuing warnings, suspension or termination of your Membership, denying access, and/or removal of any Content on the site, including Resource or Event Listings.

## 3. Resource Licensing Policy

### a. In General

**License.** Sellers on the LearnGrove Marketplace own and maintain the intellectual property rights in their Resources and grant Members licenses to use such Resources for limited use as described in this section. When you purchase a Resource, you’re purchasing a license to use the Resource in accordance with the terms of this Resource Licensing Policy. All downloadable and digitally consumed Resources can only be used in accordance with a license. 

Your use of any Resource, regardless of license type and whether the license is purchased by you, or purchased for you as a gift or on your behalf by your school or other entity, is subject to this Resource Licensing Policy and other terms set forth in these Terms. You agree to comply with the terms of this Resource Licensing Policy as well as any additional terms the Seller provides in the Resource Listing, to the extent that such terms do not conflict with these Terms. In the event of any conflict between this Resource Licensing Policy and a Seller’s terms, this Resource Licensing Policy will govern, except that Sellers may grant certain additional rights to their Resources.

### b. Individual License

A Resource license may only be assigned to a single specific individual user (“Assignee”) (e.g. one specific teacher) for that Assignee’s lifetime use. Individual Licenses are non-transferable and may not be used by or reallocated to a different Assignee (for example, a teacher who purchases an Individual License can use such Resource, in accordance with this section, for her or his lifetime but cannot transfer use of such Resource to another teacher after her or his retirement).  

Except as otherwise stated in these Terms (such as in the “Limitations on Access” section set forth below), with an Individual License, the Seller grants to the purchasing Member, for use by one Assignee, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, limited license to use the Resource for the purposes and under the conditions described below. The Seller may grant additional rights at their discretion.

If you purchase a Resource, the seller permits you to:
- Assign use of the Resource to one Assignee. Once an Assignee has been designated, the license cannot be used by any other individual, but you can purchase additional licenses as needed.

As the Assignee of the License, the Seller permits you to: 

- Use the Resource for personal, educational, and instructional use (“Personal Use”). This means you can use Resources for your own personal purposes, for your individual study, and to teach your students.

- Print and make copies of downloadable Resources as necessary for Personal Use. Copies may be made and provided to your students, classroom aides, and substitute teachers as necessary. Copies may also be made for students’ parents, classroom observers, supervisors, or school administrators for review purposes only. 

- Deliver Resources electronically as needed by using features available through the Services or by other secure means that enable access to Resources by only your students (and as needed, their parent/caregiver) (“Permitted Recipients”). You may not upload Resources to websites, applications, shared drives or other sites or services in a way that enables access by anyone other than Permitted Recipients.

Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the Seller:

- You may not resell the Resource.
- Except as permitted above to deliver Resources electronically to Permitted Recipients, you may not post or otherwise make the Resource available on any website, application, shared drive or other sites or services.
- You may not share, send, sell, sublicense, or transfer the Resource to someone else for their own Personal Use unless you purchase an additional license for each additional learning facilitator you will share it with. Each Individual License is for use by one specific learning facilitator only.

### c. Limitations on Access

**Downloadable Resources.** Datagrove cannot guarantee continuous access to any Resource through our Service. For example, if at any time, Datagrove stops hosting a Resource for any reason or you or Datagrove terminates, suspends, downgrades, or otherwise limits your Account or access to Datagrove’s Services, your ability to access the Resource through our Services may be terminated. It’s your responsibility to maintain and store a copy of downloadable Resources on your device to ensure future access. Some resources uploaded to our Service by Sellers may create accessibility issues when accessed with screen readers or other assistive technologies.

**Security of Resources.** Prior to downloading any Resource, you are responsible for making sure it is properly scanned to ensure it does not contain or transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful software programs.

## 4. Intellectual Property and Security

### a. The Services and Site Content

Except for Content uploaded or posted by Members, all other aspects of the Site and the Apps you find on our Services are owned or controlled by us. This includes, but is not limited to, all text, graphics, photographs, logos, and other imagery, videos, user interfaces, trademarks, and other content of our Site or Apps (collectively, “Site Assets”). This also includes the design, structure, coordination, arrangement, and expression of Site Assets. Site Assets are protected by copyright, trademarks, trade dress, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights.

### b. Your Content

**Rights you grant us.** Some parts of our Services allow you to upload or post Content. You retain any intellectual property rights that you hold in that Content. Datagrove does not take or claim any ownership (copyright, trademark, or otherwise) over your Content.

When you post or upload Content to our Services, you grant to us limited rights to store, use, display, and provide access to the Content you post as necessary to provide our Services, such as to display your Content in search results, to make your Content available for download, and to display and promote your Content through our Services, through email, and ads on other sites or search engines, and through other marketing campaigns. For these purposes, you grant to us a nonexclusive, irrevocable, perpetual (except as otherwise provided herein), worldwide, sublicensable license to exercise any copyright, trademark rights, or other rights in and to your Content necessary to provide our Services to you and our other Users.

**Rights you grant to others.** When a Member purchases a license to use your resource or a ticket to attend your Event (even for free content), you allow them to use your Resource or access your Event in accordance with the license terms above and any other terms you expressly set forth in writing in connection with the Listing as long as any additional terms do no conflict with these Terms.

**Security of your Content.** Prior to uploading any Content, you are responsible for making sure it is properly scanned to ensure it does not contain or transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful software programs. Uploading harmful or malicious content may result in your Listing being removed or your account being closed. We may also report incidents to the appropriate authorities.

**Effect of account closure or Listing deactivation.** If you close your account or delete or deactivate a Listing, the Listing will no longer be available for Members to find and purchase. Datagrove will continue to store your Listing and make it available for download, access, or use by Members who have previously purchased, accessed, or used the Listing subject to any additional limitations of these Terms. Datagrove will continue to display your other Content unless you remove them from the Services before closing your account. Removed Content will not be displayed but may continue to be stored on our servers.

### c. Reporting Listings

We respect your intellectual property rights and expect all Members to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding intellectual property. No Member may post any Content that infringes on the copyright, trademark, or patent rights of someone else. We expect all Listings posted by a Member to be that Member’s original work or that the Member has all appropriate rights, licenses, or authorizations necessary to use that content.

We may close accounts that repeatedly or egregiously violate this policy. 

Please review our [Copyright & Trademark policy](/policies/copyright) which explains our process for complying with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). That policy is incorporated as part of these terms.

## 5. Payments, Earnings, and Payout

### a. Purchasing and Refunds

**Refunds.** Except in limited circumstances detailed below, all sales are considered final and nonrefundable once an order has been placed. Datagrove may choose to modify or, on a case-by-case basis at its sole discretion, issue refunds for reasons not detailed below. Sellers may choose to issue a refund at their own expense and discretion by contacting us at support@learngrove.co.

Refund requests may be submitted to support@learngrove.co for the following reasons:
-  Compromised Listing File(s) - Download does not contain the files offered in the listing (eg. preview instead of full file etc)
- Misrepresentation - Listing preview or description misrepresents what is actually contained in the download 

**Payments and Currency.** Datagrove offers a number of payment options through our processing partners. We accept payments in United States dollars (USD). We cannot accept payment in cash or foreign currency. Payment methods may be added or discontinued at any time at our sole discretion.

**Promise to Pay.** When you make a purchase on the Services you represent and warrant that you have the authority to make such a purchase and to use the payment information provided. You agree that we may charge the payment method provided and acknowledge that Datagrove is not responsible for any additional fees that may be charged by your financial institution. If a Seller chooses to issue a refund or otherwise use their account balance to cover a transaction and the balance is insufficient, you agree that we may charge that against the payment method on file and/or against future sales on the Services.

**Failure to Pay and Payment Disputes.** Failure to pay may result in Listings being removed from your account, Account suspension or closure, removal of active Listings on the Services (for sellers), or any other action we deem necessary. If you dispute a Datagrove charge with your financial institution we may rebut this claim and we may also remove that Listing from your account during the dispute and permanently if the dispute is found in your favor. We may also take any action we deem necessary against your Account.

### b. Earnings

For each sale through the LearnGrove marketplace, sellers will be paid with the formula stated on our [Seller Fees and Payouts policy](https://support.learngrove.co/creators-fees/). Datagrove may change the payout policy at its discretion. Changes will be communicated to Sellers prior to their effective date.

**Payouts.** Sellers may initiate a payout at their discretion through their seller account page. Payouts will automatically be dispersed after two years in accordance with United States requirements if a Seller does not initiate a payout manually. 

**Payout Account.** It is the Sellers responsibility to maintain their account with our third party processor in good standing such that their account is eligible for transfers and payouts. If you have questions regarding the status of your account, please contact the payment processor who maintains your account. In cases where your account is not in good standing we may retain fees collected as voluntary platform contributions or pay them out in an alternative method at our discretion. We may, at our discretion, change the available/required payment processors for Payout services. 

**Payment Service Fees.** Payment service providers may assess fees on your payouts. These fees will be deducted from your Payout. The transaction fees are subject to change at the discretion of the Payment Service Provider or Datagrove at any time. We are not responsible for any additional fees, taxes, or other charges you may incur from third parties related to processing your Payouts.

### c. Sales Tax 

Sellers are responsible for the collection and payment of sales tax, use tax, goods & services tax, Value Added Tax and any other similar taxes that may be owed as a result of a sale (collectively “Sales Tax”).

*Seller Obligations.** 
- Product Tax Codes. You must provide an accurate tax code for each Listing. In cases where there is a pre-populated tax code you must verify that the tax code is correct. You may be liable for any under payments or penalties as a result of misclassification of your Listing.
